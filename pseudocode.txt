Main Loop:
	- Per room
		- Generate costmatrix
		- If Spawn present
			- Test for start conditions ( <2 containers, no grunts ) ** Only at start of room
				- Spawn starter unit ( 1 carry, 1 work, 2 move)
					- Unit programmed with 3 goals
						1. keep spawn at 300 energy
						2. build 2 containers (1 at nearest source, 1 at controller) ** later feature: add automatic placement
						3. get source container to 600 energy
			- Test for stage one (>=2 containers, 1 harvester/starter, >= 300 energy in container) ** Permanent stage
				- Spawn 2 grunts (dynamic move=carry, 0 work), secondary spawn upgrader (max work, 1 carry, 1 move), tertiary spawn builder (work=carry, move to match)
					- Grunt Goals
						1. keep spawn full
						2. Charge Towers
						3. keep upgrader container full
						4. fill any non-source containers
					- Builder Goals
						1. Repair (Check for towers, if they exist skip unless all build work is done *or* towers are low on power)
						2. Build
				- Switch starter unit role to harvester
				- Maintain 1 harvester for each source/source_container pair (work up 5, 1 carry, 1 move, add more move if work is maxed)
					- Harvester Goals
						1. Move to unharvested source
						2. Harvest
						3. Fill container
					- Test for and maintain harvester refresh rate
				- Cache paths between containers and spawn
			- Test for stage two (>=1 harvester, >=1 builder, >=2 grunts, >=1 upgrader, no active build projects, memory does not show this step as done) ** Only once
				- Spawn road construction projects between all containers and source (note in memory for room)
				- Spawn extension projects?
				- Spawn tower?
			- Test for stage three (>=5 extensions, >=1 tower, no active build projects) ** Only at prompt (later might activate automatically to "reclaim")
				- Wait for user prompt
					- Spawn claimer
					- Claim adjacent room
					- Generate inter-room grunts, harvester, builder, upgraders upon request from "child" room
		- If Spawn not present
			- Stage One (nothing present but units)
				- Request harvester, grunt, builder, upgrader (in that order) from parent room
			- Stage Two (harvester available)
				- Harvest source and build container
			- Stage Three (builder available)
				- Build container near controller
				- If grunt present, go to container
			- Stage Four (all base units available)
				- Maintain room until Spawn can be created

Starter:
	- Standard Harvest, Recharge, Build

Harvester:
	- Move to nearest source with a container and no harvester
	- Harvest
	- Transfer to container

Grunt:
	- Harvest (but with containers rather than sources)
	- Recharge Spawn / Extensions
	- Recharge Towers
	- Recharge Upgrade container
	- Recharge any extraneous containers * (can put this off)

Builder:
	- Harvest (but with containers rather than sources)
	- Repair
	- Build

Upgrader:
	- Move to controller
	- Transfer from container to controller
